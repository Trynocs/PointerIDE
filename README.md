## What Is Pointer?

Pointer is an independent editor distribution built from the Pointer-Core codebase. It keeps the familiar layered editor architecture, Monaco editor foundation, extension model, terminal stack, and desktop integration, while shipping as its own product.

Pointer is **not** an official Microsoft product, is **not** Microsoft-signed, and does **not** use the official Microsoft Marketplace. Product identity lives in [product.json](product.json), including the app name, data folders, URL protocol, Windows IDs, server name, tunnel name, themes, and built-in extensions.

## Quick Start

| Goal | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Start existing dev output | `run\start.bat` | Launches the app only. No watcher, install, rebuild, or compile. |
| Start live dev mode | `run\start-dev.bat` | Ensures dependencies, starts the watcher, and launches Pointer. |
| Stop dev processes | `run\dev-stop.bat` | Stops Pointer dev watchers and app processes for this repo. |
| Build portable release | `run\build-pointer.bat` | Creates a packaged app under `.build\artifacts\`. |
| Build ZIP + installer | `run\build-pointer.bat --Zip --Installer` | Creates portable, ZIP, and Inno Setup installer artifacts. |
